1. Project Title
AI-Powered Resume Builder

2. Project Overview (What’s the Idea?)
The AI-Powered Resume Builder is a tool designed to help users create professional resumes quickly and easily. Users input their details (e.g., name, skills, work experience), and the AI generates a polished, well-structured resume in seconds. The tool also provides suggestions for improving the resume, such as adding relevant keywords or rephrasing sections for better clarity.

Key Features:

Input Form : Users fill out a simple form with their personal and professional details.
AI-Generated Resume : Automatically formats the input into a professional resume template.
Keyword Optimization : Suggests industry-specific keywords to improve ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility.
Export Options : Allows users to download the resume as a PDF or Word document.
3. Rationale & Market Relevance
Why This Project?
Creating a resume can be time-consuming and challenging, especially for individuals unfamiliar with professional formatting or keyword optimization. Many job seekers struggle to make their resumes stand out, which can hinder their chances of landing interviews.

Real-World Problem Addressed:

Lack of access to professional resume-building tools.
Difficulty in optimizing resumes for ATS systems.
Limited knowledge of industry-specific keywords.
Value Addition:
This project simplifies the resume-building process by leveraging AI to generate professional, optimized resumes. It is particularly useful for students, entry-level job seekers, and professionals looking to update their resumes quickly.

4. Workflow & Methodology
Approach:
The project uses a combination of NLP techniques and predefined templates to generate resumes. Here’s how it works:

Input Collection : Users provide their details via a web form.
Template Selection : The system selects a professional resume template based on the user's role (e.g., software developer, teacher).
AI Suggestions : The system analyzes the input and suggests improvements, such as adding relevant keywords or rephrasing sentences.
Resume Generation : The AI combines the input and suggestions into a polished resume.
Export : Users can download the resume in PDF or Word format.
AI/ML Models & Tools:

NLP/NLU : spaCy or NLTK for analyzing input text and suggesting improvements.
LLMs : A lightweight model like GPT-2 for generating polished sentences.
Backend Framework : Flask/FastAPI for serving the application.
Frontend : Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript form for user input.
PDF Generation : Use libraries like ReportLab or pdfkit to export resumes as PDFs.
Development Workflow:

Design Input Form : Create a basic web form for collecting user details.
Define Templates : Prepare 2-3 professional resume templates.
AI Suggestions : Implement keyword optimization using NLP techniques.
Resume Generation : Combine input data with templates to generate the resume.
Testing : Test the tool with sample inputs to ensure accuracy.
Deployment : Host the tool on a free platform like GitHub Pages or Streamlit Cloud.
5. ERD & Workflow
Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):
The ERD defines relationships between key components:

Users : Stores user preferences and interaction history.
Templates : Contains predefined resume templates.
Keywords : Lists industry-specific keywords for optimization.
Workflow Diagram:

User Input : User fills out a form with their details.
AI Analysis : The system analyzes the input and suggests improvements.
Template Selection : The system selects a suitable resume template.
Resume Generation : Combines input, suggestions, and template to create the resume.
Export : User downloads the resume as a PDF or Word document.
Step-by-Step Interaction Flow:

User enters their details (name, skills, work experience) into a web form.
The system analyzes the input and suggests improvements (e.g., "Add 'Python' to your skills section").
The system selects a template and generates the resume.
The user downloads the resume in their preferred format.
